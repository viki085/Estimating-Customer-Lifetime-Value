We will be working on the Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset by Olist.

Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. 
The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. 
Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
